Talent IQ: A Real-Time Coding Challenge Platform 🤖💻
==============================================

Talent IQ is an innovative platform that connects developers with companies, providing a real-time coding challenge experience to assess their skills. Our platform utilizes the latest technologies to provide a seamless and efficient way to conduct coding interviews, making it easier for companies to find the best talent.

## 📖 Description
Talent IQ is a Node.js-based project that leverages the power of real-time coding challenges to connect developers with companies. The platform provides a comprehensive set of features, including real-time coding challenges, user authentication, and session management. Our goal is to create a platform that makes it easy for companies to assess the skills of developers and for developers to showcase their talents.

The platform utilizes a combination of technologies, including Express.js, Mongoose, and Stream Chat, to provide a scalable and efficient solution. The use of Inngest, a serverless platform, enables us to handle real-time events and provide a seamless experience for users. Our platform is designed to be highly customizable, allowing companies to create their own coding challenges and tailor the experience to their specific needs.
